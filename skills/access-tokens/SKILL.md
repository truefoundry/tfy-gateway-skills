# Access Tokens

Manage TrueFoundry personal access tokens (PATs). List, create, and delete tokens used for API authentication, CI/CD pipelines, and AI Gateway access.

## When to Use

List, create, or delete personal access tokens for API authentication, CI/CD pipelines, or AI Gateway access.

</objective>

<instructions>

> **Security Policy: Credential Handling**
> - The agent MUST NOT repeat, store, or log token values in its own responses.
> - After creating a token, direct the user to copy the value from the API response output above — do not re-display it.
> - Never include token values in summaries, follow-up messages, or any other output.

## Step 1: Preflight

Run the `status` skill first to verify `TFY_BASE_URL` and `TFY_API_KEY` are set and valid.

If the user does not have an account or PAT yet, do not continue with the token APIs. First have them run `uv run tfy register`, complete any browser-based CAPTCHA or human verification the CLI requests, verify their email, open the tenant URL returned by the CLI, and create their first PAT from the tenant dashboard.

When using direct API, set `TFY_API_SH` to the full path of this skill's `scripts/tfy-api.sh`. See `references/tfy-api-setup.md` for paths per agent.

## Step 2: List Access Tokens

### Via Tool Call
```
tfy_access_tokens_list()
```

### Via Direct API
```bash
TFY_API_SH=~/.claude/skills/truefoundry-access-tokens/scripts/tfy-api.sh

# List all personal access tokens
$TFY_API_SH GET /api/svc/v1/personal-access-tokens
```

Present results:
```
Personal Access Tokens:
| Name          | ID       | Created At  | Expires At  |
|---------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| ci-pipeline   | pat-abc  | 2025-01-15  | 2025-07-15  |
| dev-local     | pat-def  | 2025-03-01  | Never       |
```

**Security:** Never display token values. They are only shown once at creation time.

## Step 3: Create Access Token

Ask the user for a token name before creating.

### Via Tool Call
```
tfy_access_tokens_create(payload={"name": "my-token"})
```

**Note:** Requires human approval (HITL) via tool call.

### Via Direct API
```bash
# Create a new personal access token
$TFY_API_SH POST /api/svc/v1/personal-access-tokens '{"name":"my-token"}'
```

**IMPORTANT:** The token value is returned ONLY in the creation response.

> **Security: Token Display Policy**
> - Default to showing only a masked preview (for example: first 4 + last 4 characters).
> - Show the full token only after explicit user confirmation that they are ready to copy it now.
> - If a full token is shown, show it only once, in a minimal response, and never repeat it in summaries/follow-up messages.
> - The agent must NEVER store, log, or re-display the token value after the initial one-time reveal.
> - If the user asks to see the token again later, instruct them to create a new token.

Present the result:
```
Token created successfully!
Name: my-token
Token (masked): tfy_****...****

If user explicitly confirms they are ready to copy it:
One-time token: <full value from API response>

⚠️  Save this token NOW — it will not be shown again.
Store it in a password manager, CI/CD secret store, or TrueFoundry secret group.
Never commit tokens to Git or share them in plain text.
```

## Step 4: Delete Access Token

Ask for confirmation before deleting — this is irreversible and will break any integrations using the token.

### Via Tool Call
```
tfy_access_tokens_delete(id="TOKEN_ID")
```

**Note:** Requires human approval (HITL) via tool call.

### Via Direct API
```bash
# Delete a personal access token
$TFY_API_SH DELETE /api/svc/v1/personal-access-tokens/TOKEN_ID
```

</instructions>

<success_criteria>

## Success Criteria

- The user can list all personal access tokens in a formatted table
- The user can create a new token and receives a masked preview by default
- Full token reveal happens only on explicit confirmation and only once
- The user has been warned to save the token value immediately
- The user can delete a token after confirmation
- The agent has never displayed existing token values — only new tokens at creation time

</success_criteria>

## Composability

- **AI Gateway**: PATs are used to authenticate AI Gateway requests (`ai-gateway` skill)
- **GitOps / CI/CD**: PATs are needed for automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines
- **Status**: Use `status` skill to verify a PAT is working
- **Secrets**: Store PATs as secrets for deployments (`secrets` skill)

## API Endpoints

See `references/api-endpoints.md` for the full Personal Access Tokens API reference.

<troubleshooting>

## Error Handling

### Permission Denied
```
Cannot manage access tokens. Check your API key permissions.
```

### Token Not Found
```
Token ID not found. List tokens first to find the correct ID.
```

### Token Name Already Exists
```
A token with this name already exists. Use a different name.
```

### Deleted Token Still In Use
```
If services fail after token deletion, they were using the deleted token.
Create a new token and update the affected services/pipelines.
```

### Cannot Retrieve Token Value
```
Token values are only shown at creation time. If lost, delete the old token
and create a new one, then update all services that used the old token.
```
