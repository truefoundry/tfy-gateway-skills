# Access Control

Manage TrueFoundry roles, teams, and collaborators. Roles define permission sets, teams group users, and collaborators grant access to specific resources.

## When to Use

List, create, or delete roles, teams, and collaborators on TrueFoundry. Use when managing permissions, organizing users into teams, or granting/revoking access to workspaces, applications, MCP servers, or other resources.

</objective>

<instructions>

## Roles

Roles are named permission sets scoped to a resource type. Built-in roles vary by resource type (for example, `workspace-admin`, `workspace-member`).

When using direct API, set `TFY_API_SH` to the full path of this skill's `scripts/tfy-api.sh`. See `references/tfy-api-setup.md` for paths per agent.

### List Roles

#### Via Tool Call

```
tfy_roles_list()
```

#### Via Direct API

```bash
# Set the path to tfy-api.sh for your agent (example for Claude Code):
TFY_API_SH=~/.claude/skills/truefoundry-access-control/scripts/tfy-api.sh

# List all roles
$TFY_API_SH GET /api/svc/v1/roles
```

# Example SUBJECT: user:alice@company.com
```

## Collaborators

Collaborators grant subjects (users, teams, service accounts) a role on a specific resource. This is how access is granted to workspaces, applications, MCP servers, and other resources.

### Subject Format

Subjects follow the pattern `type:identifier`:

| Subject Type       | Format                        | Example                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| User               | `user:email`                  | `user:alice@company.com`       |
| Team               | `team:slug`                   | `team:platform-team`           |
| Service Account    | `serviceaccount:name`         | `serviceaccount:ci-bot`        |
| Virtual Account    | `virtualaccount:name`         | `virtualaccount:shared-admin`  |
| External Identity  | `external-identity:name`      | `external-identity:github-bot` |

### List Collaborators on a Resource

#### Via Tool Call

```
tfy_collaborators_list(resource_type="workspace", resource_id="RESOURCE_ID")
```

#### Via Direct API

```bash
# List collaborators on a workspace
$TFY_API_SH GET '/api/svc/v1/collaborators?resourceType=workspace&resourceId=RESOURCE_ID'

# List collaborators on an MCP server
$TFY_API_SH GET '/api/svc/v1/collaborators?resourceType=mcp-server&resourceId=RESOURCE_ID'
```

### Presenting Collaborators

```
Collaborators on workspace "prod-workspace":
| Subject                   | Role             | ID       |
|---------------------------|------------------|----------|
| user:alice@company.com    | workspace-admin  | collab-1 |
| team:platform-team        | workspace-member | collab-2 |
| serviceaccount:ci-bot     | workspace-member | collab-3 |
```

### Add Collaborator

#### Via Tool Call

```
tfy_collaborators_create(payload={"resourceType": "workspace", "resourceId": "RESOURCE_ID", "subject": "user:alice@company.com", "roleId": "ROLE_ID"})
```

**Note:** Requires human approval (HITL) via tool call.

#### Via Direct API

```bash
$TFY_API_SH POST /api/svc/v1/collaborators '{"resourceType":"workspace","resourceId":"RESOURCE_ID","subject":"user:alice@company.com","roleId":"ROLE_ID"}'
```

### Remove Collaborator

#### Via Tool Call

```
tfy_collaborators_delete(payload={"resourceType": "workspace", "resourceId": "RESOURCE_ID", "subject": "user:alice@company.com"})
```

**Note:** Requires human approval (HITL) via tool call.

#### Via Direct API

```bash
$TFY_API_SH DELETE /api/svc/v1/collaborators '{"resourceType":"workspace","resourceId":"RESOURCE_ID","subject":"user:alice@company.com"}'
```

## Common Workflows

### Grant a User Access to a Workspace

1. List roles to find the appropriate role ID (e.g., `workspace-admin` or `workspace-member`)
2. Add the user as a collaborator on the workspace with that role

```bash
# 1. Find the role ID
$TFY_API_SH GET /api/svc/v1/roles

# 2. Add collaborator
$TFY_API_SH POST /api/svc/v1/collaborators '{"resourceType":"workspace","resourceId":"WORKSPACE_ID","subject":"user:alice@company.com","roleId":"ROLE_ID"}'
```

### Create a Team and Grant Access

1. Create the team
2. Add members to the team
3. Add the team as a collaborator on the target resource

```bash
# 1. Create team
$TFY_API_SH POST /api/svc/v1/teams '{"name":"ml-engineers","description":"ML engineering team"}'

# 2. Add members (use team ID from response)
$TFY_API_SH POST /api/svc/v1/teams/TEAM_ID/members '{"subject":"user:alice@company.com","role":"member"}'

# 3. Grant team access to a workspace
$TFY_API_SH POST /api/svc/v1/collaborators '{"resourceType":"workspace","resourceId":"WORKSPACE_ID","subject":"team:ml-engineers","roleId":"ROLE_ID"}'
```

### Audit Access on a Resource

List all collaborators to see who has access and with what role:

```bash
$TFY_API_SH GET '/api/svc/v1/collaborators?resourceType=workspace&resourceId=WORKSPACE_ID'
```

</instructions>

<success_criteria>

## Success Criteria

- The user can list all roles and see them in a formatted table
- The user can create a custom role with specific permissions
- The user can list all teams and their members
- The user can create a team and add/remove members
- The user can list collaborators on any resource type
- The user can add a collaborator (user, team, or service account) to a resource with a specific role
- The user can remove a collaborator from a resource
- The agent has confirmed any create/delete operations before executing

</success_criteria>

<references>

## Composability

- **Preflight**: Use `status` skill to verify credentials before managing access control
- **Before deploy**: Set up teams and grant workspace access so team members can deploy
- **With workspaces**: Grant collaborator access to workspaces for users and teams
- **With MCP servers**: Manage MCP server collaborators and role assignments on registered servers
- **With secrets**: Grant access to secret groups via collaborator roles
- **Dependency chain**: Create roles first, then create teams, then reference both when adding collaborators

<troubleshooting>

## Error Handling

### Role Not Found
```
Role ID not found. List roles first to find the correct ID.
```

### Team Not Found
```
Team ID not found. List teams first to find the correct ID.
```

### Permission Denied
```
Cannot manage access control. Check your API key permissions — admin access may be required.
```

### Collaborator Already Exists
```
Collaborator with this subject and role already exists on the resource. Use a different role or remove the existing collaborator first.
```

### Invalid Subject Format
```
Invalid subject format. Use the pattern "type:identifier" — e.g., user:alice@company.com, team:platform-team, serviceaccount:ci-bot.
```

### Resource Not Found
```
Resource not found. Verify the resourceType and resourceId are correct. List the resources first to confirm.
```

### Cannot Delete Built-in Role
```
Built-in roles cannot be deleted. Only custom roles can be removed.
```
