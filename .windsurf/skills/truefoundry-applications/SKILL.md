# Applications

List, inspect, and manage applications and deployments on TrueFoundry.

## When to Use

List, inspect, or manage deployed applications and their deployment history. Also supports creating deployments via API manifest for pre-built images.

## When NOT to Use

- User wants to deploy local code → prefer `deploy` skill; ask if the user wants another valid path
- User wants workspace/cluster info → prefer `workspaces` skill; ask if the user wants another valid path
- User wants to delete an application → guide them to the TrueFoundry UI (see "Deleting Applications" below)

</objective>

<instructions>

## Execution Priority

For simple read/list operations in this skill, always use MCP tool calls first:
- `tfy_applications_list`
- `tfy_applications_list_deployments`

If tool calls are unavailable because the MCP server is not configured, or a tool is missing, fall back automatically to direct API via `tfy-api.sh`.

## IMPORTANT: Deleting Applications

**Deletion is NOT supported via CLI, API, or any agent tool. Do NOT call any delete endpoint or attempt to delete applications programmatically.**

When a user asks to delete, remove, or destroy an application, **do NOT list apps for selection**. Instead, immediately respond with:

```
To delete an application, use the TrueFoundry dashboard:

1. Open your TrueFoundry dashboard (TFY_BASE_URL in your browser)
2. Navigate to **Deployments** → select the workspace
3. Find the application you want to delete
4. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** on the application card → **Delete**
5. Confirm the deletion when prompted

⚠️ This action is irreversible — all pods, endpoints, and deployment history for this application will be permanently removed.
```

**Do NOT attempt to call any delete API on behalf of the user. Do NOT list applications to ask which one to delete. Simply provide the UI instructions above.**

---

## List Applications

When using direct API, set `TFY_API_SH` to the full path of this skill's `scripts/tfy-api.sh`. See `references/tfy-api-setup.md` for paths per agent.

### Via Tool Call

```
tfy_applications_list()
tfy_applications_list(filters={"workspace_fqn": "my-cluster:my-workspace"})
tfy_applications_list(filters={"application_name": "my-app"})
tfy_applications_list(app_id="app-id-here")
```

### Via Direct API

```bash
# Set the path to tfy-api.sh for your agent (example for Claude Code):
TFY_API_SH=~/.claude/skills/truefoundry-applications/scripts/tfy-api.sh

# List all
$TFY_API_SH GET /api/svc/v1/apps

# Filter by workspace
$TFY_API_SH GET '/api/svc/v1/apps?workspaceFqn=my-cluster:my-workspace'

# Filter by name
$TFY_API_SH GET '/api/svc/v1/apps?applicationName=my-app'

# Get by ID
$TFY_API_SH GET /api/svc/v1/apps/APP_ID
```

### Filter Parameters

| Parameter | API Key | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `workspace_fqn` | `workspaceFqn` | Filter by workspace FQN |
| `application_name` | `applicationName` | Filter by app name |
| `cluster_id` | `clusterId` | Filter by cluster |
| `application_type` | `applicationType` | Filter: service, job, etc. |
| `name_search_query` | `nameSearchQuery` | Search by name substring |

## Presenting Applications

Show as a table. Use `updatedAt` from the API response for "Last Deployed" (ISO 8601 timestamp — format as date/time for readability). Use `kind` for Type and `status` for Status.

```
Applications in my-cluster:my-workspace:
| Name           | Type    | Status   | Last Deployed      |
|----------------|---------|----------|--------------------|
| tfy-tool-server | service | RUNNING  | 2026-02-10 14:30   |
| data-pipeline  | job     | STOPPED  | 2026-02-08 09:15   |
```

## List Deployments

### Via Tool Call

```
tfy_applications_list_deployments(app_id="app-id")
tfy_applications_list_deployments(app_id="app-id", deployment_id="dep-id")
```

### Via Direct API

```bash
# List deployments for an app
$TFY_API_SH GET /api/svc/v1/apps/APP_ID/deployments

# Get specific deployment
$TFY_API_SH GET /api/svc/v1/apps/APP_ID/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_ID
```

## Create Deployment (API)

For creating a deployment via API manifest (advanced — most users should use the `deploy` skill).

**Use this section when:**
- User has their own manifest/JSON and wants direct API deployment
- User explicitly requests API-based deployment instead of SDK/Python
- User wants to deploy from a pre-built image (not local code)

**For deploying local code, use the `deploy` skill instead.**

### Service Manifest Structure

A basic TrueFoundry service manifest looks like this:

```json
{
  "manifest": {
    "kind": "Service",
    "name": "my-app",
    "image": {
      "type": "image",
      "image_uri": "nginx:latest"
    },
    "ports": [
      {
        "port": 8000,
        "protocol": "TCP",
        "expose": false
      }
    ],
    "resources": {
      "cpu_request": 0.25,
      "cpu_limit": 0.5,
      "memory_request": 256,
      "memory_limit": 512
    },
    "env": {
      "KEY": "value",
      "SECRET_KEY": "tfy-secret://my-org:my-secrets:SECRET_KEY"
    },
    "replicas": {
      "min": 1,
      "max": 1
    }
  },
  "workspaceId": "ws-id-here"
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `kind` — "Service" for long-running services, "Job" for batch jobs
- `name` — Unique application name
- `image.image_uri` — Docker image (e.g., `nginx:latest`, `ghcr.io/org/app:v1.0`)
- `ports` — Array of port configs (port, protocol, expose flag)
- `resources` — CPU (cores) and memory (MB) requests/limits
- `env` — Environment variables as key-value pairs. **Security:** Never include raw secret values (passwords, API keys, tokens) in manifests. Use `tfy-secret://` references for all sensitive environment variables. See the `secrets` skill.
- `replicas` — Min/max replica count (for autoscaling)
- `workspaceId` — Workspace ID (not FQN) where the app will be deployed

### Before Submitting

> **Security: Credential Handling**
> - NEVER embed raw API keys, passwords, or tokens in manifest `env` fields.
> - Always use `tfy-secret://` references for sensitive environment variables.
> - If the user provides a raw credential, warn them and suggest creating a TrueFoundry secret group first (use the `secrets` skill).

**ALWAYS confirm with the user before creating a deployment:**

1. **Service name** — What should the app be called?
2. **Image** — Full image URI (e.g., `nginx:latest`, `ghcr.io/user/app:tag`)
3. **Resources** — CPU request/limit (cores), memory request/limit (MB)
4. **Ports** — Which ports to expose, protocols (TCP/UDP), expose to internet?
5. **Environment variables** — Any env vars needed? (Use `tfy-secret://` references for sensitive values — never inline credentials in manifests)
6. **Replicas** — How many instances? (min/max for autoscaling)
7. **Workspace ID** — Which workspace to deploy to?

Present this summary and ask for confirmation before making the API call.

### Via Tool Call

```
tfy_applications_create_deployment(
    manifest={
        "kind": "Service",
        "name": "my-app",
        "image": {"type": "image", "image_uri": "nginx:latest"},
        "ports": [{"port": 8000, "protocol": "TCP", "expose": false}],
        "resources": {"cpu_request": 0.25, "cpu_limit": 0.5, "memory_request": 256, "memory_limit": 512},
        "env": {"KEY": "value"},
        "replicas": {"min": 1, "max": 1}
    },
    options={"workspace_id": "ws-id-here", "force_deploy": true}
)
```

**Note:** This requires human approval (HITL) when using tool calls.

### Via Direct API

```bash
$TFY_API_SH PUT /api/svc/v1/apps '{
  "manifest": {
    "kind": "Service",
    "name": "my-app",
    "image": {"type": "image", "image_uri": "nginx:latest"},
    "ports": [{"port": 8000, "protocol": "TCP", "expose": false}],
    "resources": {"cpu_request": 0.25, "cpu_limit": 0.5, "memory_request": 256, "memory_limit": 512},
    "env": {"KEY": "value"},
    "replicas": {"min": 1, "max": 1}
  },
  "workspaceId": "ws-id-here"
}'
```

### Common Deployment Patterns

**Web service (exposed to internet with public URL):**

The `host` must match one of the cluster's `base_domains`. Look up base domains first:
```bash
$TFY_API_SH GET /api/svc/v1/clusters/CLUSTER_ID
# → look for base_domains, pick the wildcard one (e.g., "*.ml.your-org.truefoundry.cloud")
# → strip "*." to get the base domain: "ml.your-org.truefoundry.cloud"
# → construct host: "{service-name}-{workspace-name}.{base_domain}"
```

```json
{
  "ports": [{
    "port": 8080,
    "protocol": "TCP",
    "expose": true,
    "host": "my-app-dev-ws.ml.your-org.truefoundry.cloud",
    "app_protocol": "http"
  }],
  "replicas": {"min": 2, "max": 5}
}
```

**If `host` does not match a cluster base domain, deploy will fail with: "Provided host is not configured in cluster".**

**Internal service (not exposed):**
```json
{
  "ports": [{"port": 8000, "protocol": "TCP", "expose": false}],
  "replicas": {"min": 1, "max": 1}
}
```

**Resource-intensive service:**
```json
{
  "resources": {
    "cpu_request": 1.0,
    "cpu_limit": 2.0,
    "memory_request": 2048,
    "memory_limit": 4096
  }
}
```

<success_criteria>

## Success Criteria

- The user can see the status of their deployed applications in a clear, formatted table
- Unhealthy or stopped deployments are identified with actionable next steps (check logs, redeploy)
- The agent has filtered results by the correct workspace when the user specified one
- The user can find a specific application by name, ID, or workspace
- Deployment details (replicas, resources, image, ports) are surfaced when the user asks for more info

</success_criteria>

<references>

## Composability

- **After listing apps**: Use `logs` skill to check logs, `deploy` skill to redeploy
- **After deploy**: Use this skill to verify the deployment succeeded
- **Check jobs**: Use `jobs` skill for job-specific run details
- **Find workspace first**: Use `workspaces` skill to get workspace FQN for filtering

</references>

<troubleshooting>

## Error Handling

### No Applications Found
```
No applications found. Check:
- Workspace FQN is correct
- You have apps deployed in this workspace
- Your API key has access to this workspace
```

### Application Not Found
```
Application ID not found. List apps first to find the correct ID.
```

### Permission Denied
```
Cannot access this application. Check your API key permissions.
```
