# GitOps with TrueFoundry

Set up GitOps-style deployments with TrueFoundry. Store deployment configurations as YAML specs in Git and auto-deploy on push using `tfy apply` in CI/CD pipelines.

## When to Use

Set up automated Git-based deployments with `tfy apply`. Store TrueFoundry YAML specs in Git and auto-deploy on push/merge via CI/CD pipelines.

## When NOT to Use

- User wants to deploy manually from local code → prefer `deploy` skill; ask if the user wants another valid path
- User wants to deploy an LLM model → prefer `llm-deploy` skill; ask if the user wants another valid path
- User wants to check what's deployed → prefer `applications` skill; ask if the user wants another valid path
- User wants to deploy a Helm chart → prefer `helm` skill; ask if the user wants another valid path
- User just wants to check TrueFoundry connection → prefer `status` skill; ask if the user wants another valid path

</objective>

## Prerequisites

**Always verify before setting up GitOps:**

1. **Credentials** — `TFY_BASE_URL` and `TFY_API_KEY` must be set (env or `.env`)
2. **TrueFoundry CLI** — `tfy` CLI must be available in the CI/CD environment (installed via `pip install truefoundry`)
3. **Git repository** — A Git repo to store deployment specs

For credential check commands and .env setup, see `references/prerequisites.md`. Use the `status` skill to verify connection before proceeding.

## How GitOps Works with TrueFoundry

GitOps treats Git as the single source of truth for deployment configurations. The workflow is:

1. **Store specs in Git** — All TrueFoundry resource YAML specs live in the repository
2. **Review via pull requests** — Changes are reviewed before merging, with `tfy apply --dry-run` validating specs in CI
3. **Auto-deploy on merge** — When specs are merged to the default branch, `tfy apply` deploys them automatically
4. **Full audit trail** — Git history tracks every change, who made it, and when

## Repository Organization

Organize your repo with directories for each resource type:

```
truefoundry-configs/
├── clusters/
│   └── my-cluster/
│       ├── dev-workspace/
│       │   ├── my-api-service.yaml
│       │   ├── my-worker.yaml
│       │   └── my-llm.yaml
│       ├── staging-workspace/
│       │   ├── my-api-service.yaml
│       │   └── my-worker.yaml
│       └── prod-workspace/
│           ├── my-api-service.yaml
│           └── my-worker.yaml
├── gateway/
│   ├── models.yaml
│   ├── guardrails.yaml
│   └── tool-servers.yaml
├── integrations/
│   └── custom-integration.yaml
├── teams/
│   └── my-team.yaml
└── virtualaccounts/
    └── my-account.yaml
```

### Key Principles

- **One YAML file per resource** — Each TrueFoundry resource (service, job, model, etc.) gets its own file
- **Filename matches resource name** — The YAML filename should match the `name` field inside the spec
- **Separate directories per workspace** — Keep dev, staging, and prod configs in separate directories
- **Extract specs from the UI** — Use "Edit -> Apply Using YAML" in the TrueFoundry dashboard to get the YAML spec for any existing resource

## Manifest File Structure

Each YAML spec follows the standard TrueFoundry manifest format. For example, a service spec:

```yaml
type: service
name: my-api-service
image:
  type: image
  image_uri: my-registry/my-app:latest
  command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
ports:
  - port: 8000
    expose: true
    protocol: TCP
    app_protocol: http
    host: my-api-dev.ml.example.truefoundry.cloud
workspace_fqn: my-cluster:dev-workspace
env:
  APP_ENV: development
  LOG_LEVEL: debug
replicas:
  min: 1
  max: 3
resources:
  cpu_request: 0.5
  cpu_limit: 1.0
  memory_request: 512
  memory_limit: 1024
```

## Environment-Specific Configs (Dev / Staging / Prod)

Maintain separate YAML files per environment. Common differences:

| Setting | Dev | Staging | Prod |
|---------|-----|---------|------|
| `replicas.min` | 1 | 1 | 2+ |
| `replicas.max` | 1 | 3 | 10+ |
| `resources.cpu_request` | 0.25 | 0.5 | 1.0+ |
| `resources.memory_request` | 256 | 512 | 1024+ |
| `env.LOG_LEVEL` | debug | info | warn |
| `ports.host` | `*-dev.*` | `*-staging.*` | `*-prod.*` |
| `workspace_fqn` | `cluster:dev-ws` | `cluster:staging-ws` | `cluster:prod-ws` |

Example directory layout:

```
clusters/my-cluster/
├── dev-workspace/
│   └── my-service.yaml       # min resources, 1 replica, debug logging
├── staging-workspace/
│   └── my-service.yaml       # moderate resources, autoscaling, info logging
└── prod-workspace/
    └── my-service.yaml        # full resources, HA replicas, warn logging
```

## Using `tfy apply` in CI/CD Pipelines

The `tfy apply` command is the core of GitOps with TrueFoundry.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Install TrueFoundry CLI (pin exact version to prevent supply-chain attacks)
pip install 'truefoundry==0.5.3'

# Authenticate (uses TFY_HOST and TFY_API_KEY env vars)
# TFY_HOST is the TrueFoundry platform URL (same as TFY_BASE_URL)

# Dry run — validate without deploying
tfy apply --file path/to/spec.yaml --dry-run

# Apply — deploy the spec
tfy apply --file path/to/spec.yaml
```

### Applying Multiple Files

To apply all changed files in a CI/CD pipeline, detect which files were modified in the commit or PR:

```bash
# Apply each changed YAML file
while IFS= read -r file; do
  [ -z "$file" ] && continue
  echo "Applying $file..."
  tfy apply --file "$file"
done < <(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD -- '*.yaml')
```

### Handling Deleted Files

When a YAML spec file is deleted from the repo, the corresponding resource should be removed. The CI/CD pipeline should detect deleted files and handle them:

```bash
# Warn about deleted files
while IFS= read -r file; do
  [ -z "$file" ] && continue
  echo "WARNING: $file was deleted. Remove the resource manually from the TrueFoundry dashboard."
done < <(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D HEAD~1 HEAD -- '*.yaml')
```

## CI/CD Integration

For complete workflow files for each CI provider:

- **GitHub Actions**: See [references/gitops-github-actions.md](references/gitops-github-actions.md) -- PR validation (dry-run) and merge-to-deploy workflows, plus required secrets setup.
- **GitLab CI**: See [references/gitops-gitlab-ci.md](references/gitops-gitlab-ci.md) -- validate and deploy stages with caching.
- **Bitbucket Pipelines**: See [references/gitops-bitbucket-pipelines.md](references/gitops-bitbucket-pipelines.md) -- PR validation and branch-based deploy.

All providers require `TFY_HOST` and `TFY_API_KEY` as repository secrets/variables.

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up GitOps (Summary)

1. **Verify TrueFoundry connection** — Use the `status` skill to confirm credentials
2. **Create the repo structure** — Set up directories for your resource types (clusters, gateway, etc.)
3. **Export existing specs** — In the TrueFoundry dashboard, go to each resource -> Edit -> Apply Using YAML. Save each spec as a YAML file in the repo.
4. **Add CI/CD workflows** — Copy the appropriate workflow files for your CI provider (see above)
5. **Set repository secrets** — Add `TFY_HOST` and `TFY_API_KEY` as secrets/variables in your CI provider
6. **Test with a dry run** — Open a PR with a small change to verify the validation pipeline works
7. **Merge and deploy** — Merge the PR and confirm the apply pipeline deploys successfully

## Success Criteria

- The user has a Git repository with TrueFoundry YAML specs organized by environment (dev/staging/prod)
- The CI/CD pipeline validates specs on pull requests using `tfy apply --dry-run`
- The CI/CD pipeline auto-deploys specs on merge to the default branch using `tfy apply`
- The agent has provided the user with the correct CI workflow files for their CI provider (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Bitbucket Pipelines)
- Repository secrets (`TFY_HOST`, `TFY_API_KEY`) are configured in the CI provider
- The user can verify the pipeline works by opening a PR with a small YAML change and seeing validation pass

## Composability

- **Verify connection first**: Use `status` skill to check TrueFoundry credentials
- **Find workspace FQN**: Use `workspaces` skill to get workspace FQNs for your specs
- **Check existing deployments**: Use `applications` skill to see what is already deployed
- **Deploy LLM models via GitOps**: Use `llm-deploy` skill to generate the manifest YAML, then store it in Git
- **Manage secrets**: Use `secrets` skill to set up secret groups referenced in your specs
- **View deployment logs**: Use `logs` skill to debug deployments after apply

<troubleshooting>

## Error Handling

### tfy apply Failed — Invalid Spec

```
tfy apply returned a validation error.
Check:
- YAML syntax is valid (no tabs, proper indentation)
- Required fields are present (type, name, workspace_fqn)
- Resource references exist (workspace, secrets, etc.)
Run: tfy apply --file spec.yaml --dry-run
```

### tfy apply Failed — Authentication Error

```
401 Unauthorized from tfy apply.
Check:
- TFY_HOST is set correctly (the platform URL, e.g., https://your-org.truefoundry.cloud)
- TFY_API_KEY is valid and not expired
- Secrets are configured correctly in your CI provider
```

### tfy apply Failed — Workspace Not Found

```
Workspace FQN in the spec does not exist.
Check:
- workspace_fqn field matches an existing workspace
- Use the workspaces skill to list available workspaces
```

### CI Pipeline Not Triggering

```
Workflow not running on push/PR.
Check:
- File path filters match your YAML file locations
- Branch filters match your default branch name
- CI provider secrets are set (TFY_HOST, TFY_API_KEY)
```

### Filename / Spec Name Mismatch

```
The YAML filename should match the 'name' field inside the spec.
Example: my-service.yaml should contain name: my-service
This is a convention for clarity — tfy apply uses the internal name, not the filename.
```
